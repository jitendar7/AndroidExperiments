// To display data in RecyclerView, below are the things required

1. Data to display
2. 'RecyclerView' instance defined in layout file, which act as a container for the views
3. A 'layout' for 1 item of data ( or more depending on usecases)
4. A 'layout manager', handles the organization of the UI components in a view
5. 'viewHolder' which extends ViewHolder class, It contains the view information for displaying
one item from the item's layout
6. Adapter connects data to RecyclerView. It adapts the data, so it can be displayed in a ViewHolder
   A Recyclerview uses the adapter to figure out how to display the data on the screen
