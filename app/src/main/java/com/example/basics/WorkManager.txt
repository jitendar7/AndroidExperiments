//pre-fetching the data once in a day

//WorkManager is for background work,
"Deferrable" => work not required to run immediately
eg: sending analytics data, syncing data
"Guaranteed" execution => task will run even when the device restarts

WorkManager will use an appropriate way either JobScheduler => API level 23+ (or)
a combination of AlarmManager & BroadcastReceiver


Adding WorkManager
implementation "android.arch.work:work-runtime-ktx:$work_version"


//Create background worker

Worker, class where you define actual work to run in the background
 extend this class, override doWork()

WorkRequest, it represents a request to run the worker in background, to configure
how & when to run the worker task, with help of Constraints such as device plugged in or WIFI connected

WorkManager, schedules & runs your WorkRequest



//Creating worker

class RefreshDataWorker(appContext: context, params: WorkParameters) : CoroutineWorker(appContext, params){
    override suspend fun doWork(): Result {     // this method is called on a background thread
      return Result.success()
    }
}

doWork() method performs work synchronously, and should return a ListenableWorker.Result object
THe Android System gives a Worker a maximum of 10mins to finish the execution and return a
ListenableWorker.Result object

To create ListenableWorker.Result object, call one of the following static methods to indicate the
completion status of the background work:

Result.success() - work completed successfully
Result.failure() - work completed with a permanent failure
Result.retry() - work encountered a transient failure & should be retried


override suspend fun doWork(): Result {
       val database = getDatabase(applicationContext)
       val repository = VideosRepository(database)
       try {
           repository.refreshVideos()
       } catch (e: HttpException) {
           return Result.retry()
       }
       return Result.success()
}

//Worker defines a unit of work,  and the WorkRequest defines how & when work should be run.
//There are two concrete implementations of the 'WorkRequest' class
- OneTimeWorkRequest ( is for on-off tasks, happens only once )
- PeriodicWorkRequest ( for periodic work, work that repeats at intervals )

//Define a periodic request in 'application',
setupRecurringWork(){
    val repeatingRequest = PeriodicWorkRequestBuilder<RefreshDataWorker>(1, TimeUnit.DAYS)      //run once a day
           .build()
}

//schedule a WorkRequest with WorkManager
WorkManager.getInstance().enqueueUniquePeriodicWork(
       RefreshDataWorker.WORK_NAME,
       ExistingPeriodicWorkPolicy.KEEP,
       repeatingRequest)

Call this in onCreate, but with a coroutine

applicationScope.launch {
       Timber.plant(Timber.DebugTree())
       setupRecurringWork()
}

If pending(uncompleted) work exists with the same name, the ExistingPeriodicWorkPolicy.KEEP parameter
makes the WorkManager keep the previous periodic work and discard the new work request


//Add Constraints, criteria when to execute a work request

// This is the final functionality, this work request will run in the background as long as the app is installed,
private fun setupRecurringWork() {

       val constraints = Constraints.Builder()
               .setRequiredNetworkType(NetworkType.UNMETERED)
               .setRequiresBatteryNotLow(true)
               .setRequiresCharging(true)
               .apply {
                   if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.M) {
                       setRequiresDeviceIdle(true)
                   }
               }
               .build()

       val repeatingRequest = PeriodicWorkRequestBuilder<RefreshDataWorker>(1, TimeUnit.DAYS)
               .setConstraints(constraints)
               .build()

       Timber.d("Periodic Work request for sync is scheduled")
       WorkManager.getInstance().enqueueUniquePeriodicWork(
               RefreshDataWorker.WORK_NAME,
               ExistingPeriodicWorkPolicy.KEEP,
               repeatingRequest)
   }
